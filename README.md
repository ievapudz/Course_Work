# Protein Classification

## Primary dataset for training

Firstly, proteomes of *Escherichia coli* (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000625) and *Sulfolobus solfataricus* (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000001974) were taken to train the model. Due to the growth conditions of each organism, *E. coli* was taken as a representative of mesophiles, assuming that the optimal conditions for its protein functionality is around 37 degrees Celsius (Jang et al. 2017). Meanwhile, *S. solfataricus* - a thermophile - has a proteome consisting of proteins, which have optimal conditions of 80 degrees Celsius (Zaparty et al. 2010).  The datasets consisted of 4392 and 2938 proteins for *E. coli* and *S. solfataricus* respectively.
